Flutter Restaurant App: A Feature-Rich Starting Point for Developers Welcome to our Flutter Restaurant App project! This app serves as an excellent foundation for developers looking to create stunning, feature-rich mobile applications using Flutter. Whether you're building a restaurant app or adapting the concepts for other projects, this codebase offers a wealth of advanced Flutter techniques and customizable components. Key Features

Cross-Fade Image Carousel The CrossFadeImage widget provides a beautiful, smooth transition between multiple images. This feature is perfect for showcasing menu items, restaurant ambiance, or any series of images you want to display in a captivating manner.
Customizable fade and display durations Smooth cross-fade transitions using AnimationController and CurvedAnimation Efficient image cycling with automatic looping

Expanding Card Route Transitions The ExpandingCardRoute class delivers a visually striking page transition effect. When a user taps on a menu card, it elegantly expands to fill the screen, creating a seamless and engaging navigation experience.
Custom PageRouteBuilder for unique transition effects Combines scaling and fade transitions for a polished look Reusable for various screen transitions throughout the app

Interactive Menu Cards The MenuCard widget creates attractive, interactive cards for different menu categories (e.g., Breakfast, Lunch). These cards showcase the power of combining multiple Flutter widgets to create a rich user interface.
Gesture recognition for tap interactions Layered design with background images and text overlays Seamless integration with the ExpandingCardRoute for smooth navigation
